# G1 — Shipped-feature-graph prove-absence gate (ADR-062 §Decision 6 / §Enforcement,
# spec §17.17 SCP-CAPSEL-8000/8001/8002 + §17.17.2 durability-vs-nullifier).
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES
# ----------------
# For every shipped artifact (the three FFI bridges plus the scp-node and
# scp-relay binaries), the COMPLETE resolved feature set of the SCP
# workspace crates is a SUBSET of a single explicit permitted-production allowlist
# (one superset list covering all five artifacts) that permits
# ONLY durability-only + real-backend features. Any resolved SCP-crate feature
# that is NOT on the allowlist — named or novel, present or future — FAILS the
# gate. This makes shipped-graph feature-absence equivalent to nullifier-type
# absence (the soundness invariant: every nullifier double —
# `InMemoryKeyCustody` / `InMemoryDeviceAttestation` / `InMemoryPreRotationCustody`
# / `InMemoryDhtClient` and the `did:key` test method — is gated behind one of the
# `testing` features of scp-platform / scp-dht / scp-did / scp-core / scp-protocol
# / scp-runtime / scp-mls, or behind the `scp-testing` crate; the whitelist admits
# none of them, so if a nullifier's gating feature is absent from the graph, the
# nullifier cannot be compiled in).
#
# WHY A CLOSED ⊆-WHITELIST, NOT A DENYLIST
# ----------------------------------------
# A denylist ("fail if `scp-platform/testing` appears") is FAIL-OPEN: a fourth
# nullifier feature, a renamed one, or the transitive `scp-protocol/Cargo.toml`
# `testing = ["scp-did/testing", …]` did:key edge would bypass it. A positive ⊆
# whitelist is CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION: anything not explicitly permitted fails,
# so novel/future nullifier features are caught without ever being named here.
# The four nullifier feature names below appear ONLY in the self-test fixtures as
# POSITIVE-CONTROL INPUTS the whitelist must reject — never as the mechanism.
#
# CRITICAL: DEV-DEPENDENCIES ARE EXCLUDED (`-e features,no-dev`)
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# A shipped artifact is built WITHOUT dev-dependencies. `cargo tree` includes
# dev-deps by default (and feature-unifies their `testing` edges into the graph),
# which does NOT reflect what ships. The `no-dev` edge kind restricts the graph to
# the normal + build dependencies that actually compile into the artifact.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-shipped-feature-graph.sh            # gate the real workspace
#   scripts/check-shipped-feature-graph.sh --self-test # run the fixture harness only
#

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Single permitted-production allowlist (EXPLICIT — the whitelist).
#
# Durability-only (SCP-CAPSEL-8010/8011) + real-backend features ONLY. Contains
# ZERO nullifier features, no exceptions (ADR-062 §Decision 6; PR #2132). The
# `assert_allowlist_has_no_nullifier` self-test enforces that invariant so a
# future edit cannot quietly add a nullifier exception.
#
# Five artifacts are gated: the three shipped FFI bridges (built
# `--no-default-features --features server`) plus the scp-node and scp-relay
# binaries (built with DEFAULT features — neither binary has a `server` feature).
# The three bridges resolve one identical SCP-crate feature set; each binary
# resolves a SUBSET of it (scp-node ~25, scp-relay ~19 SCP-crate feature edges).
# This single allowlist is therefore a SUPERSET covering all five — one list
# suffices. `cargo tree` DERIVES each artifact's resolved set (never a hand-list);
# this allowlist is the hand-maintained set of what is PERMITTED.

# Shipped artifacts and their exact PRODUCTION build invocation. Two distinct
# shipped configurations, gated exactly as they ship:
#   - FFI bridges (scp-ffi / -napi / -uniffi): built `--no-default-features
#     --features server` — their production bridge configuration.
#   - Binaries (scp-node / scp-relay): built with DEFAULT features, so the
#     feature-arg string is EMPTY. This matches the Dockerfile
#     `cargo build --release -p scp-relay -p scp-node` and the `cargo publish`
#     shipping config. NEITHER binary has a `server` feature (scp-node has no
#     `default` block wiring one; scp-relay has no `[features]` table at all),
#     so passing `--features server` here would ERROR — they are correctly gated
#     with an empty feature-arg string, not with `--features server`.
#
# DRIFT CAVEAT: each entry's build-invocation string above MUST be kept in
# lockstep with the actual shipped build config — the Dockerfile
# `cargo build --release -p scp-relay -p scp-node` and the
# `.github/workflows/release.yml` `cargo publish` steps. This gate checks the
# feature config NAMED HERE, not whatever those workflows actually build; if the
# two drift apart, coverage silently narrows (an artifact would be gated in a
# config it no longer ships).
#
# uniffi-bindgen (the third workspace `[[bin]]`, in `crates/scp-ffi/uniffi`) is
# deliberately NOT a separate ARTIFACTS entry: it is a build-time code-generation
# tool, not a shipped runtime artifact, and its dependencies are already covered
# transitively by the `scp-ffi-uniffi` package entry above.
