# G1 — Shipped-feature-graph prove-absence gate (ADR-062 §Decision 6 / §Enforcement,
# spec §17.17 SCP-CAPSEL-8000/8001/8002 + §17.17.2 durability-vs-nullifier).
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES
# ----------------
# For every shipped artifact (the three FFI bridges plus the scp-node and
# scp-relay binaries), the COMPLETE resolved feature set of the SCP
# workspace crates is a SUBSET of a single explicit permitted-production allowlist
# (one superset list covering all five artifacts) permitting durability-only +
# real-backend features and ZERO nullifier features. Any resolved SCP-crate
# feature that is NOT on this allowlist — named or novel, present or future —
# FAILS this gate. This gate's soundness invariant — shipped-graph
# feature-absence ≡ nullifier-type absence — holds for every `testing`-gated
# nullifier double (`InMemoryKeyCustody` / `InMemoryDeviceAttestation` /
# `InMemoryPreRotationCustody` / `InMemoryDhtClient` and a `did:key` test
# method, each gated behind a `testing` feature of scp-platform / scp-dht /
# scp-did / scp-core / scp-protocol / scp-runtime / scp-mls or behind an
# `scp-testing` crate, none of which this whitelist admits — so an absent gating
# feature means a nullifier cannot be compiled in), and it holds equally for
# `allow_unencrypted_storage`, which gates
# `ProtocolRepository::new_for_testing` (a constructor accepting any `Storage`,
# unsealing an `EncryptedStorage` bound that `ProtocolRepository::new` requires).
# Three `scp-*/allow_unencrypted_storage` rows sat on this allowlist until four
# shipped FFI-bridge `scp-node` dependency edges that resolved them were removed;
# `NULLIFIER_CONTROL_FEATURES` now names all three, so an
# `assert_allowlist_has_no_nullifier` fixture rejects any edit that puts them
# back.
#
# WHY A CLOSED ⊆-WHITELIST, NOT A DENYLIST
# ----------------------------------------
# A denylist ("fail if `scp-platform/testing` appears") is FAIL-OPEN: a fourth
# nullifier feature, a renamed one, or the transitive `scp-protocol/Cargo.toml`
# `testing = ["scp-did/testing", …]` did:key edge would bypass it. A positive ⊆
# whitelist is CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION: anything not explicitly permitted fails,
# so novel/future nullifier features are caught without ever being named here.
# The four nullifier feature names below appear ONLY in the self-test fixtures as
# POSITIVE-CONTROL INPUTS the whitelist must reject — never as the mechanism.
#
# CRITICAL: DEV-DEPENDENCIES ARE EXCLUDED (`-e features,no-dev`)
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# A shipped artifact is built WITHOUT dev-dependencies. `cargo tree` includes
# dev-deps by default (and feature-unifies their `testing` edges into the graph),
# which does NOT reflect what ships. The `no-dev` edge kind restricts the graph to
# the normal + build dependencies that actually compile into the artifact.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-shipped-feature-graph.sh            # gate the real workspace
#   scripts/check-shipped-feature-graph.sh --self-test # run the fixture harness only
#

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Single permitted-production allowlist (EXPLICIT — the whitelist).
#
# Durability-only (SCP-CAPSEL-8010/8011) + real-backend features. ZERO nullifier
# features is a design mandate (ADR-062 §Decision 6; PR #2132), and this list now
# carries zero — no exceptions, no disclosed residue. An
# `assert_allowlist_has_no_nullifier` self-test enforces that no
# NULLIFIER_CONTROL_FEATURES entry is added, so a future edit cannot quietly add
# a nullifier exception.
#
# `scp-platform/in-memory-push` is an intentionally-permitted, currently-unused
# durability-only entry: no shipped artifact resolves it today, but a superset
# allowlist may carry permitted-but-unresolved rows (it is durability-only, not a
# nullifier, so its presence widens nothing that matters).
#
# `scp-platform/filesystem` was such a row until three FFI bridges stopped
# depending on it: `start_node_local` no longer opens a plaintext
# `FilesystemStorage` under its data directory, so no shipped artifact resolves
# that feature. Its row is dropped rather than kept, because keeping it would let
# a future dependency edge pull plaintext key-per-file storage back into a
# shipped graph with no gate failure to announce it.
#
# Five artifacts are gated: the three shipped FFI bridges (built
# `--no-default-features --features server`) plus the scp-node and scp-relay
# binaries (built with DEFAULT features — neither binary has a `server` feature).
# The three bridges resolve one identical SCP-crate feature set; each binary
# resolves a SUBSET of it (scp-node ~25, scp-relay ~19 SCP-crate feature edges).
# This single allowlist is therefore a SUPERSET covering all five — one list
# suffices. `cargo tree` DERIVES each artifact's resolved set (never a hand-list);
# this allowlist is the hand-maintained set of what is PERMITTED.

# Shipped artifacts and their exact PRODUCTION build invocation. Two distinct
# shipped configurations, gated exactly as they ship:
#   - FFI bridges (scp-ffi / -napi / -uniffi): built `--no-default-features
#     --features server` — their production bridge configuration.
#   - Binaries (scp-node / scp-relay): built with DEFAULT features, so the
#     feature-arg string is EMPTY. This matches the Dockerfile
#     `cargo build --release -p scp-relay -p scp-node` and the `cargo publish`
#     shipping config. NEITHER binary has a `server` feature (scp-node has no
#     `default` block wiring one; scp-relay has no `[features]` table at all),
#     so passing `--features server` here would ERROR — they are correctly gated
#     with an empty feature-arg string, not with `--features server`.
#
# DRIFT CAVEAT: each entry's build-invocation string above MUST be kept in
# lockstep with the actual shipped build config — the Dockerfile
# `cargo build --release -p scp-relay -p scp-node`, a
# `.github/workflows/release.yml` `cargo publish` step, `maturin`'s
# `--manifest-path crates/scp-ffi/Cargo.toml` wheel build (which keeps default
# features and adds `extension-module`, a pyo3-only feature that changes no
# SCP-crate edge, so it resolves an `scp-ffi` set named below), and a
# `.github/workflows/build-matrix.yml` "Build shipped bridge artifacts" step,
# which builds one package per invocation into `target-shipped` so its uploaded
# cdylibs resolve those same per-package sets these entries name. This gate
# checks a feature config NAMED HERE, not whatever those workflows actually
# build; when those two drift apart, coverage silently narrows (an artifact
# would be gated in a config it no longer ships). One drift class is covered
# mechanically rather than
# by this caveat: a `default-members` check in `run_gate` resolves a bare
# `cargo build` at this root, so a member that unifies a nullifier into its
# siblings fails whether or not anyone updates this comment.
#
# uniffi-bindgen (the third workspace `[[bin]]`, in `crates/scp-ffi/uniffi`) is
# deliberately NOT a separate ARTIFACTS entry: it is a build-time code-generation
# tool, not a shipped runtime artifact, and its dependencies are already covered

#
#   `set -o pipefail` (line 48) makes a pipeline report a last non-zero exit

#   dies of SIGPIPE and returns 141, and pipefail hands 141 to `if`, which takes
#   its else branch. This probe reported "scp-testing absent" on exactly the
#   trees that carry it near a top — a FAIL-OPEN read on a gate whose whole
#   claim is ZERO nullifiers. Measured on this tree: `cargo tree -e no-dev -p
#   scp-node` prints 96,898 bytes, past a 64 KB pipe buffer, and a
#   `scp-testing v0.1.0` line prepended to it read as ABSENT under `grep -q`

#   carried an identical construct, and the pull request that made a `ci` gate
#   enforce what it claims, #2361, fixed it there.
#
#   `grep -E … >/dev/null` reads its whole input, so `printf` never receives
#   SIGPIPE and a pipeline reports grep's own verdict.
#
#   grep exits 0 on a match, 1 on no match, and 2 or higher on its own error.
#   Returning that status unchanged would make a grep error read as "no match",

#
#   WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM resolve_scp_features
#   ---------------------------------------------------
#   Every per-artifact entry above models `cargo build -p <package>`. Resolver 2
#   unifies normal-dependency features per INVOCATION, not per package, so a
#   command that builds several members at once resolves a UNION none of those
#   per-package checks sees. `.github/workflows/build-matrix.yml` runs exactly
#   such a bare `cargo build --release --target <triple>` and uploads each FFI
#   bridge cdylib it produces, and `.github/workflows/release.yml`
#   Authenticode-signs those DLLs — so a member carrying a test-harness feature
#   on a normal dependency edge would ship a nullifier through a signed binary
#   while all five per-artifact checks stayed green.
#
#   `crates/scp-testing` is such a member: its `helpers.rs` names in-memory
#   doubles at lib level, so `scp-core/testing`, `scp-platform/testing`,
#   `scp-dht/testing`, and `allow_unencrypted_storage` sit on its NORMAL edges.
#   Root `Cargo.toml` therefore omits it from `default-members`, and this check
#   is what keeps that omission true.
