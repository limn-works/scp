# G1 — Shipped-feature-graph prove-absence gate (ADR-062 §Decision 6 / §Enforcement,
# spec §17.17 SCP-CAPSEL-8000/8001/8002 + §17.17.2 durability-vs-nullifier).
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES
# ----------------
# For every shipped artifact (the three FFI bridges plus the scp-node and
# scp-relay binaries), the COMPLETE resolved feature set of the SCP
# workspace crates is a SUBSET of a single explicit permitted-production allowlist
# (one superset list covering all five artifacts) permitting durability-only +
# real-backend features — with one disclosed confidentiality-nullifier residue
# (the three `scp-*/allow_unencrypted_storage` entries, tracked for removal in
# Track B / #2292; full statement in ADR-062 §Status). Any resolved SCP-crate
# feature that is NOT on the allowlist — named or novel, present or future —
# FAILS the gate. The gate's TARGET soundness invariant — shipped-graph
# feature-absence ≡ nullifier-type absence — holds for every `testing`-gated
# nullifier double (`InMemoryKeyCustody` / `InMemoryDeviceAttestation` /
# `InMemoryPreRotationCustody` / `InMemoryDhtClient` and the `did:key` test
# method, each gated behind a `testing` feature of scp-platform / scp-dht /
# scp-did / scp-core / scp-protocol / scp-runtime / scp-mls or the `scp-testing`
# crate, none of which the whitelist admits — so an absent gating feature means
# the nullifier cannot be compiled in), but is NOT YET fully achieved while the
# disclosed `allow_unencrypted_storage` residue remains on the allowlist
# (see ADR-062 §Status / #2292).
#
# WHY A CLOSED ⊆-WHITELIST, NOT A DENYLIST
# ----------------------------------------
# A denylist ("fail if `scp-platform/testing` appears") is FAIL-OPEN: a fourth
# nullifier feature, a renamed one, or the transitive `scp-protocol/Cargo.toml`
# `testing = ["scp-did/testing", …]` did:key edge would bypass it. A positive ⊆
# whitelist is CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION: anything not explicitly permitted fails,
# so novel/future nullifier features are caught without ever being named here.
# The four nullifier feature names below appear ONLY in the self-test fixtures as
# POSITIVE-CONTROL INPUTS the whitelist must reject — never as the mechanism.
#
# CRITICAL: DEV-DEPENDENCIES ARE EXCLUDED (`-e features,no-dev`)
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# A shipped artifact is built WITHOUT dev-dependencies. `cargo tree` includes
# dev-deps by default (and feature-unifies their `testing` edges into the graph),
# which does NOT reflect what ships. The `no-dev` edge kind restricts the graph to
# the normal + build dependencies that actually compile into the artifact.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-shipped-feature-graph.sh            # gate the real workspace
#   scripts/check-shipped-feature-graph.sh --self-test # run the fixture harness only

# Single permitted-production allowlist (EXPLICIT — the whitelist).
#
# Durability-only (SCP-CAPSEL-8010/8011) + real-backend features. ZERO nullifier
# features is the design mandate (ADR-062 §Decision 6; PR #2132); the one
# disclosed `allow_unencrypted_storage` residue (the three `scp-*/...` entries
# below) is single-sourced in ADR-062 §Status / #2292 — see there for the full
# classification. The `assert_allowlist_has_no_nullifier` self-test enforces that
# no NULLIFIER_CONTROL_FEATURES entry is added, so a future edit cannot quietly
# add a *new* nullifier exception.
#
# `scp-platform/in-memory-push` is an intentionally-permitted, currently-unused
# durability-only entry: no shipped artifact resolves it today, but a superset
# allowlist may carry permitted-but-unresolved rows (it is durability-only, not a
# nullifier, so its presence widens nothing that matters).
#
# Five artifacts are gated: the three shipped FFI bridges (built
# `--no-default-features --features server`) plus the scp-node and scp-relay
# binaries (built with DEFAULT features — neither binary has a `server` feature).
# The three bridges resolve one identical SCP-crate feature set; each binary
# resolves a SUBSET of it (scp-node ~25, scp-relay ~19 SCP-crate feature edges).
# This single allowlist is therefore a SUPERSET covering all five — one list
# suffices. `cargo tree` DERIVES each artifact's resolved set (never a hand-list);
# this allowlist is the hand-maintained set of what is PERMITTED.

# Shipped artifacts and their exact PRODUCTION build invocation. Two distinct
# shipped configurations, gated exactly as they ship:
#   - FFI bridges (scp-ffi / -napi / -uniffi): built `--no-default-features
#     --features server` — their production bridge configuration.
#   - Binaries (scp-node / scp-relay): built with DEFAULT features, so the
#     feature-arg string is EMPTY. This matches the Dockerfile
#     `cargo build --release -p scp-relay -p scp-node` and the `cargo publish`
#     shipping config. NEITHER binary has a `server` feature (scp-node has no
#     `default` block wiring one; scp-relay has no `[features]` table at all),
#     so passing `--features server` here would ERROR — they are correctly gated
#     with an empty feature-arg string, not with `--features server`.
#
# DRIFT CAVEAT: each entry's build-invocation string above MUST be kept in
# lockstep with the actual shipped build config — the Dockerfile
# `cargo build --release -p scp-relay -p scp-node` and the
# `.github/workflows/release.yml` `cargo publish` steps. This gate checks the
# feature config NAMED HERE, not whatever those workflows actually build; if the
# two drift apart, coverage silently narrows (an artifact would be gated in a
# config it no longer ships).
#
# uniffi-bindgen (the third workspace `[[bin]]`, in `crates/scp-ffi/uniffi`) is
# deliberately NOT a separate ARTIFACTS entry: it is a build-time code-generation
# tool, not a shipped runtime artifact, and its dependencies are already covered
# transitively by the `scp-ffi-uniffi` package entry above.
