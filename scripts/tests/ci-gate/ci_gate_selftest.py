"""Self-test for a CI gate: workflow structure, plus an aggregate's verdict.

Every assertion here corresponds to a defect where a check ran and enforced
nothing:

  timeout      No job set `timeout-minutes`, so a hung job burned a 360-minute
               per-job runner ceiling.
  coverage     Three enforcement jobs (pyi-generated, construction-pattern,
               block-in-place) were not dependencies of `ci`, one required
               status check, so their failures never blocked a merge.
  skip         An aggregate compared results against "failure" and "cancelled"
               only, so a skipped dependency and a passing dependency produced
               one verdict.
  rust-fanout  Filters named python, typescript, kotlin and swift listed only
               bindings plus their own bridge directory, so a pull request
               touching crates/scp-runtime/ alone skipped all four test jobs.
  zero-test    `cargo test <filter>` exits 0 when a filter selects no test, so
               a fail-closed lane reported success over zero assertions.
  scaled-input Two fuzz jobs pass a workflow_dispatch input to libFuzzer as
               `-max_total_time`, so an operator sets how long they run. A
               budget fixed above a scheduled run cancelled every dispatch
               asking for longer, killing a run that previously completed.
  filter-key   An aggregate read an absent `needs.changes.outputs.<key>` as "",
               which compares unequal to every literal, so one renamed filter
               held a job at `skipped` forever under a green required check.
  action-ref   fuzz.yml named `dtolnay/rust-toolchain@nightly-2026-05-03`, a
               ref that action's repository does not publish, so every
               scheduled fuzz run failed in about six seconds and every timeout
               budget this file checks on that workflow guarded nothing.

Assertions over an aggregate's verdict read which jobs a scenario selects out
of SCENARIOS below, never out of the aggregate itself. Six of them once built
that expectation by calling `evaluate` in scripts/ci-aggregate-result.py, the
same function whose verdict they then judged, so each one agreed with that
function however it behaved.

# artifact names, and a PyPI URL, none of which decide duration. `dry-run` does
# not — a boolean guards `if:` conditions that skip jobs, which can only shorten
