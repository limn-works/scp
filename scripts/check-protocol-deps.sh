# async-trait is excluded: it's a proc-macro that generates trait impls at
# compile time and does not pull in an async runtime at run time.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION: This check catches banned CRATE dependencies but does
# NOT catch direct std::time::SystemTime usage. SystemTime compiles on
# wasm32 but returns wrong values (epoch). The Clock trait enforcement
# (privatized free functions in scp-primitives) handles that case.
# The WASM compilation check also does NOT catch SystemTime for the same
# reason — it compiles, just gives wrong results. Three complementary
# checks cover the sync invariant:
#   1. This script: no banned crate deps
#   2. check-protocol-sync.py: no async fn in production code (tree-sitter)
#   3. WASM compilation: no tokio/openmls (they don't compile on wasm32)
#   4. Clock trait: SystemTime access privatized in scp-primitives
