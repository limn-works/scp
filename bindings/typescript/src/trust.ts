/**
 * Trust module types for the SCP TypeScript SDK.
 *
 * Defines aggregation/participation wire types. Trust evaluation is
 * agent-level — the engine provides validated inputs (behavioral
 * records, attestations, challenge results), not trust scores.
 *
 * The functional entry points (`aggregateTrustInput`,
 * `verifyParticipationRequirements`, and the TS-side
 * `evaluateTrust` sugar) moved onto the {@link SCP} class in Phase 4
 * PR 4 (#1549, ADR-048) as `scp.aggregateTrustInput(...)` and
 * `scp.verifyParticipationRequirements(...)`. `evaluateTrust` was
 * pure TypeScript sugar over `eventLogQuery` — callers now compose
 * those primitives directly. The free-function shims that predated
 * ADR-048 were deleted in the same commit.
 *
 * See ADR-017 (Trust Engine) and ADR-022 in `.docs/adrs/phase-4.md`.
